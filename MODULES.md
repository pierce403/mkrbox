# MKRBOX Modules (Draft)

## Tool interface
- Shared mechanical mount with quick-change latching.
- Power + data bus (spec in progress).
- Tool presence + health reporting.

## Example modules
- Gripper (soft + rigid variants).
- Screwdriver / fastener tool.
- Inspection camera + lighting.
- Small router / cutter.
- Cable routing and wiring tool.

## Electrical + data bus
- Connector form factor (TBD).
- Supported voltages and current limits.
- Low-latency telemetry channel for tool state.

## Open questions
- Standardized tool-change time target.
- Payload class per module category.
- Safety interlocks for high-energy tools.
