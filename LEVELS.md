# MKRBOX Levels (Draft)

## Level design goals
- Teach new tools and workflows step-by-step.
- Introduce failure states and recovery actions.
- Reward optimized sequencing and safe operator handoffs.

## Example level arcs
1. Calibration + reach test.
2. Simple pick-and-place with operator-supplied parts.
3. Fastening and inspection loop.
4. Multi-tool assembly with failure recovery.

## Repair fantasy
- Diagnose a misalignment.
- Swap a tool or module.
- Re-run the sequence with updated constraints.

## Open questions
- Scoring system and progression rewards.
- Target completion time per level.
- Visual style for the sim UI.
