# MKRBOX Spec (Draft)

## Footprint + reach
- Footprint: 1 m² base target.
- Kinematic reach envelope: ~1 m³.
- Work envelope vs. full machine volume is still being refined.

## Bays + subsystems
- Input bay: operator handoffs for parts and consumables.
- Output bay: finished goods, test samples, or subassemblies.
- Tool rack: standardized power + data interface for tool changes.
- Sensor suite: vision, force/torque, environmental monitoring.
- Compute bay: GPU/edge stack for sim + planning.

## Safety + access
- Physical interlocks and soft limits.
- Clear operator handoff zones.
- Documented emergency stop behavior.

## Mounting + standards
- Modular mounting grid (TBD).
- Known datum points for calibration.
- Repeatable tool-change interface.

## Open questions
- Exact enclosure dimensions and service access.
- Payload and repeatability targets.
- Sensor stack depth for first prototype.
